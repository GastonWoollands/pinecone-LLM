This repository explores a novel approach to facilitating informative conversations with large language models (LLMs) by leveraging semantic search with Pinecone and Hugging Face embeddings.

The core workflow:

    Document Embedding:
        Input a PDF document.
        Split it into manageable chunks.
        Generate dense vector representations of each chunk using Hugging Face embeddings.
        Upload these vectors to a Pinecone vector database.

    Contextualized Interaction:
        Formulate a question about the document.
        Convert the question into a vector using the same embeddings.
        Retrieve the most semantically similar document chunks from the Pinecone database based on the question vector.
        Provide these relevant chunks to the LLM as context.

    Enhanced LLM Dialogue:
        Engage in a focused conversation with the LLM, guided by the retrieved context.
        Gain deeper insights and understanding of the document through the LLM's responses.

Benefits:

    Precise Context: Delivers targeted information to the LLM for more relevant and insightful communication.
    Efficient Search: Leverages Pinecone for fast and accurate retrieval of the most relevant document segments.
    Scalability: Adapts to documents of varying size and complexity.
